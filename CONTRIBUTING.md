### Write some documentation

If you use Islandora Context and you have documented a task for yourself, consider sharing it with other users. We'd be happy to include your contribution in the Islandora Context README or link to it if you'd rather maintain it somewhere else.

### Report a bug

In order to help us understand and fix the bug it would be useful if you could provide us with:

1. The steps to reproduce the bug. This includes information about e.g. the Islandora version you were using along with version of stack components.
2. If applicble, some sample data that triggers the bug.
3. The expected behavior.
4. The current, incorrect behavior.

Feel free to search the issue queue for existing issues that already describe the problem; if there is such a ticket please add your information as a comment.

**If you want to provide a pull along with your bug report:**

In this case please send us a pull request as described in section _Create a pull request_ below.

### Contribute code

Contributions to the Islandora Context codebase should be sent as GitHub pull requests. See section _Create a pull request_ below for details. If there is any problem with the pull request we can work through it using the commenting features of GitHub.

* For all code contributions, please use the following process in order to to prevent any wasted work and catch design issues early on.

    1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_context/issues) and assign it the label of "enhancement", if a similar issue does not exist already. If a similar issue does exist, then you should consider participating in the work on the existing issue.
    2. Comment on the issue with your plan for implementing the enhancement. Explain what pieces of the codebase you are going to touch and how everything is going to fit together.
    3. The Islandora Context maintainers will work with you on the design to make sure you are on the right track.
    4. Implement your issue, create a pull request (see below), and iterate from there.
    5. Please run `drush dcs --extensions=inc` and `drush coder-review --reviews=production,security,style,i18n,potx,sniffer islandora_context` before committing to your branch.

#### Issue / Topic Branches

All issues should be worked on in separate git branches. The branch name should be the same as the GitHub issue number, e.g., issue-243.

### Create a pull request

Take a look at [Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). In a nutshell you need to:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the Islandora Context repository to your personal GitHub account. See [Fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) for detailed instructions.
2. Commit any changes to the issue/topic branch in your fork. Comments can be as terse as "Work on #243.", etc. but you can be more descriptive if you want. However, please refer to the issue you are working on somewhere in the commit comment using GitHub's '#' shortcut, as in the example.
3. Send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to the Islandora Context repository that you forked in step 1 (in other words, https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_context).
4. Complete the pull request template.

You may want to read [Syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork) for instructions on how to keep your fork up to date with the latest changes of the upstream (official) Islandora Context repository.

### Workflow for testing and merging pull requests

Smoke tests are required for the work you are contributing. In other words, a human needs to test your work to confirm it does what it is intended to do and that it doesn't introduce any side effects. You are expected to provide sample Islandora Context commands and, if applicable, input data to allow the reviewer to perform the smoke tests.
